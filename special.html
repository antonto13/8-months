		Happy 8 Months my love ♡. It is crazy to think we've made it so far. I cannot thank you enough for being with me for so long. I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong. Be it failing to understand you or hurt you. I never meant any of it. I promise I'll be better. And I promise we'll see each other one day. I hope you'll be able to wait long enough. Like I am. I love you so much Jam. Thank you again for 8 beautiful months and hopefully we can make it to more (preferably a full year :>). I love you ♡♡♡
