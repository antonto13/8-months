Everytime I look at your ig posts or tiktoks, the comments are just filled with people calling you pretty or complimenting you (you're mine >:( *insert image of a muscular alpha wolf ripping his shirt under the moonlight*). You are very pretty. If the word had a physical manifestation, it would be you
