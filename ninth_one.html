		It is no surprise that I absolutely adore BLASTER. I've been treating him like my own son. But that's not the only gift I've been cherishing. I love the sweater you gave me (even though I can't wear it) and the money you sent. I put it to good use. And I love you letters so much. Everytime I re-read them, I die inside. I can't believe someone loves me so much that they'd write such heartfelt letters
